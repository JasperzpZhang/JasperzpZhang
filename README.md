👋 Hey, I’m Jasper
🧩 Embedded software developer, passionate about building reliable, real-time systems on microcontrollers.
🧠 I enjoy diving into low-level programming, RTOS design, and writing clean, efficient C code that runs close to the metal.
🌱 Currently exploring FreeRTOS and sharpening my skills in task management, inter-task communication, and system architecture.
🤝 Always up for collaborating on embedded C projects — especially those with tight timing, tough constraints, and interesting challenges.
